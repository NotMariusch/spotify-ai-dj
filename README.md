# Spotify AI DJ

A local automated Spotify DJ that runs as a background service on Windows. It selects artists from curated pools, filters tracks, learns your listening preferences over time, discovers new artists similar to ones you already enjoy, and supports natural language requests via an AI chat mode powered by Claude.

## Features

- **5 modes** switchable via hotkeys at any time
- **AI chat mode** — type a natural language request and the DJ uses Claude to pick matching artists, searches Spotify for them, and plays continuously from that selection until you switch modes or send a new request. AI plays are fully isolated from the weight system
- **Web dashboard** — browser-based control panel at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`. Shows live DJ output and voice/chat logs in real time, displays current artist and track name, active mode indicator, playback status, and buttons for all controls (skip, ban, modes, AI requests)
- **AI voice mode** — press F13+V (Right Ctrl + V) to start recording, press again to stop. Works globally even in fullscreen games. Transcribed via Google Speech Recognition and sent to the AI DJ
- **Smart track filtering** — removes remixes, live versions, sped-up/slowed, language alternate versions, concert recordings, and other alternates automatically
- **Weight system** — tracks play-through rate per artist per mode and adjusts selection probability over time. Artists you consistently listen through get picked more often; artists you skip get picked less
- **Artist discovery** — when an artist's weight crosses a threshold, the DJ queries Last.fm for similar artists, resolves each candidate on Spotify, quality-checks their catalog, and adds passing candidates to the pool for a trial period. Artists that earn enough play-throughs are permanently saved
- **Continuous playback** — plays songs back to back automatically, picking a new weighted-random artist from the active mode's pool after each track. Pausing in Spotify stops the DJ without auto-resuming — resume manually via your keyboard, Spotify app, or switch modes to start a new track
- **Persistent track cache** — fetches each artist's catalog once and caches it for 7 days, keeping API calls near zero during normal use
- **Persistent recent history** — remembers recently played tracks across restarts to avoid immediate repeats
- **Skip hotkey** — F13+6 skips the current track, applies the correct weight penalty, and immediately picks the next track from the active mode's pool
- **Duplicate instance protection** — lock file prevents two instances running simultaneously
- **Crash recovery** — automatically restarts after unhandled exceptions and logs all crashes and exits to `data/dj_crash.log`

## Setup

**1. Clone the repo:**
```
git clone https://github.com/NotMariusch/spotify-ai-dj
cd spotify-ai-dj
```

**2. Create the data folder placeholder** (if it doesn't exist after cloning):
```
type nul > data\.gitkeep
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Create a `.env` file in the project root:**
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```

**5. Register a Last.fm API key** (free, required for artist discovery):
- Create an account at [last.fm](https://www.last.fm) (use mobile app if the website registration is broken)
- Go to [last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create) and fill in any application name
- Copy the API key into your `.env` as `LASTFM_API_KEY`

**6. Register a Spotify app:**
- Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Create an app and add `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` as a redirect URI
- Copy the Client ID and Secret into your `.env`

**7. Get a Claude API key** (required for AI chat/voice mode):
- Sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- Add credits (a small amount like $5 lasts hundreds of requests at this usage level)
- Copy the API key into your `.env` as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**8. Install AutoHotkey v2** and run `scripts/dj_hotkey.ahk` (can be set to run on startup)

**9. Open Spotify and start playing anything on your target device, then run:**
```
start_dj.bat
```
The first run fetches and caches all artists (~1 minute with rate-limit delays). After that, subsequent startups load from cache instantly.

> **Note:** Spotify enforces strict API rate limits. If you hit a limit during the first fetch (startup will print a warning and stop early), the DJ will still run using whichever artists were cached successfully. The missing artists will be retried automatically on the next startup once the ban window expires (can be several hours). Do not delete `track_cache.json` between runs unless necessary.

**10. For normal background use:**
```
start_dj_hidden.vbs
```
This launches the DJ with no visible window. The VBS also prevents duplicate instances from starting.

## AI Chat Mode

With the DJ running, open a second terminal and run:
```
python scripts/dj_chat.py
```

Type any natural language request and press Enter:
```
You: play some current pop hits
You: I want chill anime music
You: give me hype rap
You: something dark and moody
```

The DJ will ask Claude for matching artists, search Spotify for each one, and start playing from that pool continuously. AI plays never affect your weight system — your carefully tuned weights are completely unaffected.

To return to a normal mode, use any hotkey (F13+1 through F13+5) or send a new AI request.

You can also send regular commands through the chat window:
```
You: skip
You: ban
You: 3        ← switches to K-Pop mode
```

## AI Voice Mode

With the DJ running, open a second terminal and run:
```
python scripts/dj_voice.py
```

Press **F13+V** (Right Ctrl + V) once to start recording, press again to stop. The voice input is transcribed by Google Speech Recognition (free, no API key needed) and sent to Claude as an AI request — same as typing in the chat window.

Works globally even when you are tabbed into a fullscreen game. The terminal window just needs to stay open in the background.

**Tips for best results:**
- Describe the vibe rather than naming specific artists — "play some German trap" works better than naming artists directly, since speech recognition may mishear artist names
- Claude will pick the right artists based on your description regardless

Voice mode requires two additional packages:
```
pip install sounddevice numpy keyboard
```

## Hotkeys

Requires AutoHotkey v2 running `scripts/dj_hotkey.ahk`. Right Ctrl is remapped to F13 to avoid conflicts in games.

| Hotkey | Action |
|--------|--------|
| F13 + 1 | American Rap mode (Juice WRLD, XXXTENTACION, Ski Mask, A Boogie) |
| F13 + 2 | German Trap mode (tj_beastboy, Sierra Kidd) |
| F13 + 3 | K-Pop mode (LE SSERAFIM, BLACKPINK, NewJeans, K/DA, aespa) |
| F13 + 4 | J-Pop mode (Ado, YOASOBI, Eve, BABYMETAL, Aimer) |
| F13 + 5 | Global mode (all artists, weighted random) |
| F13 + 6 | Skip current track |
| F13 + 8 | Ban current track permanently |
| F13 + 9 | Quit DJ cleanly |
| F13 + V | Toggle voice recording (via dj_voice.py) |

## How the Weight System Works

Each artist starts at weight `1.0` per mode. At every track boundary the DJ judges the previous track:

| Condition | Weight change |
|-----------|--------------|
| Played 80%+ naturally | +0.15 |
| Skipped or banned in first 25% | -0.10 |
| Switched between 25–80% | No change |
| Mode switch (any point) | No change |
| AI mode play (any point) | No change |

Weights are clamped between `0.2` (floor) and `3.0` (ceiling). `weighted_choice()` uses these as probabilities so higher-weight artists get picked more often without ever fully excluding lower-weight ones.

**To reset all weights:** delete `data/dj_memory.json`

## How Artist Discovery Works

When an artist's weight reaches `3.0` (the ceiling) in any mode, there is a 25% chance a discovery search is queued for that mode. This means only artists you genuinely love trigger discovery, and the pool grows gradually rather than flooding with new artists every session.

At the next track boundary the DJ queries Last.fm's `artist.getSimilar` endpoint, resolves each candidate's Spotify ID via search, filters candidates to those with at least 5 clean (non-alternate) tracks available in DE, and adds the first passing candidate to the pool as a trial artist at weight `1.0`.

Trial artists need 5 play-throughs of 80%+ to graduate. Graduated artists are permanently saved to `data/discovered_artists.json` and reloaded into pools on every restart.

## Data Files Reference

| File | Purpose | Reset by deleting? |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `track_cache.json` | Cached artist track lists | Yes — refetched on next startup |
| `dj_memory.json` | Artist weights per mode | Yes — all weights reset to 1.0. Also delete if you rename modes, as old mode keys become orphaned |
| `recent_tracks.json` | Recently played titles | Yes — repeat protection clears |
| `discovered_artists.json` | Discovered/graduated artists | Yes — discovery history lost |
| `banned_tracks.json` | Permanently banned track IDs | Yes — all bans cleared |
| `dj_crash.log` | Crash and exit log | Yes — safe to delete anytime |
